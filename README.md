Glottis Segmentation (nnU-Net v2) + Calibration-Independent Area Measurement
This project segments the glottis region from endoscopic images and computes a scale-invariant, calibration-independent glottal area metric.

Problem
Pixel-based area measurements change with camera–tissue distance and zoom, making direct comparison unreliable when pixel-to-mm calibration is unavailable.

Method
Pipeline:

Glottis segmentation with nnU-Net v2 (trained on the BAGLS dataset)
Pixel area computation (A) from the predicted binary mask
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on mask foreground pixels to estimate the dominant anatomical axis length (L)
Scale-invariant normalized area metric: A / L²

Scale-Invariant Area Metric (A / L²)
Normalized Area Comparison

The A / L² formulation compensates for scale variations caused by camera distance or zoom, enabling consistent comparison across samples.
